Part 2 - Scoring

Use scoring. 

When play begins:
	now score is 0;
	if Vorple is supported:
		open HTML tag "div" called "score";
		place a level 3 header reading "Score: [score]";
		close HTML tag;
	if Vorple is not supported:
		now the left hand status line is "Score: [score]"; 

The maximum score is 74.

Check switching score notification off: 
	if the turn count is less than 10: 
		say "You are still a novice, grasshopper. Allow your teacher to give you advice until such time as you are ready to go on alone." 
		
To say score notification message:
	(- NotifyTheScore(score); -).

This is the enhanced notify score changes rule:
	if Vorple is supported:
		If the last notified score is not the score:
			display a notification reading "[score notification message]";
			now the last notified score is the score;
			open HTML tag "div" called "score";
			place a level 3 header reading "Score: [score]";
			close HTML tag;
	otherwise:
		follow the notify score changes rule.

The enhanced notify score changes rule is listed instead of the notify score changes rule in the turn sequence rulebook.
		
Part 3 - Nautical Directions

A room can be nautical or earthbound. A room is usually not nautical. A direction can be nautical or earthbound. A direction is usually not nautical. Starboard, port, fore, aft, up, down, the inside and the outside are nautical.
Before going a nautical direction when the location is not nautical, say "Nautical directions can only be used on board the ISS."
Before going an earthbound direction when the location is nautical, say "Compass directions make no sense on board the ISS, but you can use [list of nautical directions] instead." instead.
 
Starboard is a direction. The starboard has opposite port. Understand "s" as starboard when the location is nautical.
Port is a direction. The port has opposite starboard. Understand "p" as port when the location is nautical.
Fore is a direction. The fore has opposite aft. Understand "f" as fore when the location is nautical.
Aft is a direction. The aft has opposite fore. Understand "a" as aft when the location is nautical.
Does the player mean going a nautical direction when the location is nautical: it is very likely.
Index map with fore mapped as north. Index map with aft mapped as south. Index map with port mapped as west. Index map with starboard mapped as east.

•It is hoped that this investigation provides knowledge that may impact disease modeling, drug discovery, and Heart cell therapy.

Description

With extended stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS) becoming commonplace and as NASA prepares for exploration class space missions beyond low earth orbit, the need to better understand and mitigate the negative effects of spaceflight on various bodily and cellular functions is becoming increasingly important. Specifically, there is great interest in the effects of microgravity on the human heart, with a particular emphasis on understanding the microgravity effects on cardiomyocyte physiology and gene expression. The goal of the Effects of Microgravity on Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes for Human Cardiovascular Disease Modeling and Drug Discovery (Heart Cells) investigation is to look further into the effects.
 
Primary human heart tissues, which would be useful for in vitro microgravity studies on heart function, are very difficult to obtain and maintain in culture. Likewise, the characteristics of animal cells are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that their use is limited. Instead, this investigation aims to use heart cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which have emerged as a novel tool for drug discovery and cell therapy in cardiovascular medicine, to study the effects of microgravity on cardiac function and gene expression.";

		 decrease score by score;
		place an image "gameover.jpg" with the description "", centered;
		say "Experiment Failed[line break]WHAT ARE YOU DOING![line break][line break] Why are you handling precious lab material without first putting on nitrile gloves. You've contaminated the heart cells and ruined a very expensive experiment. [paragraph break] I'm not sure you're the right person for our team. SHAME!";	
		end the story. 
		
Checking Biocell Habitat for leakage is an action applying to nothing. Understand "Check BioCell Habitat for leakage" and "Check Biocell for leakage" and "Verify no Biocell leakage" as checking BioCell Habitat for Leakage. 

Checking Multiwell Habitat for leakage is an action applying to nothing. Understand "Check Multiwell  Habitat for leakage" and "Check Multiwell for leakage" and "Check multiwell for leaks" as checking multiwell habitat for leakage. 

Every turn when checking Biocell Habitat for leakage:
	if a random chance of 9 in 10 succeeds, say "You examine the Biocell Habitat and find that there is no leakage."; 
	otherwise increase score by 5;
	say "You discover there has been a leakage in the BioCell Habitat. You clean the leakage using the Clean Up Kit and are now ready to continue with the experiment."; 	
		
Every turn when checking Multiwell Habitat for leakage:
	if a random chance of 9 in 10 succeeds, say "You examine the Multiwell Habitat for leakage and find that there is no leakage.";
	otherwise increase score by 5;
	say "You detect a leak in the BioCell  You clean the leakage using the Clean Up Kit and are now ready to continue with the experiment."; 

Phase Two ends when insert multiwell biocell onto stage. 

Chapter 3 - Phase Three

Phase Three is a scene. Phase Three begins when Phase Two ends. 

Insert Multiwell BioCell onto Stage is an action applying to nothing. Understand "insert multiwell biocell onto stage" and "insert multiwell onto stage" as insert multiwell biocell onto stage. 

Instead of insert multiwell biocell onto stage:
	 say "You first raise the shield covering the stage. Then you carefully insert the multiwell onto stage with the ports facing upward. You make sure to angle the back edge of the Multiwell BioCell into the stage first and then press down on the front edge to snap it into place."; increase score by 4. 
	
Lower microscope shield is an action applying to nothing. Understand "Lower microscope shield" and "lower shield" as lower microscope shield. 

Instead of lower microscope shield:
	say "Microscope shield lowered."; increase score by 5. 

Chapter 4 - Phase Four

Phase Four is a scene. Phase four begins when Phase Three ends. 
	
Staging cleanup kit is an action applying to nothing. Understand "Stage cleanup kit near microscope" and "stage clean up kit near microscope" and "stage cleanup kit" and "stage clean up kit" as staging cleanup kit. 

After staging cleanup kit:
	say "You place the CleanUp kit near the microscope just in case there is any undedetected leakage that you will need to address.". 

Fold up the glove bag is an action applying to nothing. Understand "fold up glove bag" and "fold up the glove bag" and "fold up glove bag" as fold up the glove bag. 

Instead of fold up the glove bag:
	say "Seeing that there were no leakages you fold up the glove bag and place it back into its bag for future use." 

Instead of taking off nitrile gloves:
	increase score by 10;
	end the story saying "Good job Astonaut. You've succesfully completed the Heart Cell Experiment and the data that you collect will be useful as we continue to see how long term exposure to microgravity effects the human body. [paragraph break] Once again good, NO, great job!";
	place an image "cheering.jpg"with the description "YOU DID IT!", centered;
